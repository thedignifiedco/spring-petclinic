## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Report via email
Send an email to: [hi@thedignified.co](mailto:hi@thedignified.co)

### 3. Include the following information:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a solution (optional)

### 4. Response timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)

## Vulnerability Severity Levels

### Critical (P0)
- **Response**: Immediate (within 24 hours)
- **Fix**: Within 7 days
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass

### High (P1)
- **Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix**: Within 14 days
- **Examples**: SQL injection, XSS, privilege escalation

### Medium (P2)
- **Response**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix**: Within 30 days
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, CSRF

### Low (P3)
- **Response**: Within 1 week
- **Fix**: Within 90 days
- **Examples**: Minor information disclosure, UI improvements

## Security Measures

### Code Quality
- All code changes require security review
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Regular security audits

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access
- Regular access reviews
- Secure development practices

### Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Intrusion detection
- Regular security assessments
- Vulnerability scanning

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Coordinated release**: Fixes are released with coordinated disclosure
3. **Credit acknowledgment**: Security researchers are credited (if desired)
4. **No legal action**: We won't take legal action against security researchers

## Security Updates

### Automatic Updates
- Dependencies are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities
- Security patches are applied automatically when possible
- Critical security updates trigger immediate releases

### Manual Updates
- Security team reviews all security-related changes
- Changes are tested thoroughly before release
- Rollback plans are prepared for critical updates

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices and industry standards:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
- [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html)

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a formal bug bounty program, but we do acknowledge and credit security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Security Changelog

All security-related changes are documented in our [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file with the `[SECURITY]` tag.
